// Ok basic idea:

// You get some words, put them in an array. 
//show a game menu, 1: start game 2: high scores 3: exit
// 1:
// Game begins 
// user prompt starts so user can enter words, when they do they are moved out of a temporary array. 
// interval starts so that words are automatically randomly pulled from source array and into temporary array. a corresponding "time" array holds a counter for the word in the same position.
//every second the game ticks down every word that is still there, if one gets to 0, you lose a point. when you lose 5 points, game exits

// there are 2 known bugs, let me know if they end up hindering you
